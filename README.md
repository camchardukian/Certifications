In this repository I've included some of the certifications I've earned to improve my skills as a software developer.

Some organizations I've earned certificates from include:

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most widely adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services.

AWS Certifications help learners build credibility and confidence by validating their cloud expertise with an industry-recognized credential.

They are also useful for helping organizations identify skilled professionals to lead cloud initiatives using AWS.

## FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is an open-source community that offers developers a structured software development curriculum that focuses on project based learning and critical thinking rather than merely following along with tutorials.

## HackerRank

HackerRank is a technology hiring platform used by over 2,000 companies worldwide to help tech recruiters and hiring managers objectively evaluate talent.

## Learn Cantrill

Adrian Cantrill is seen by many in the [AWS certification space](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/) as the best teacher of AWS.

He offers lengthy courses that focus on acquiring skills in the AWS ecosystem.

His philosophy is that courses tailored to passing certifications are a waste of time.

He instead teaches real-world skills and covers topics so deeply such that passing the certification exams is merely a byproduct of completing his courses.

## Udemy

Udemy is a popular online course provider that arranges coursework into a series of modules that can include videos, exercises, and assessments.
