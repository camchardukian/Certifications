In this repository I've included some of the certifications I've earned to improve my skills as a software developer.

Some organizations I've earned certificates from include:

## FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is an open-source community that offers developers a structured software development curriculum that focuses on project based learning and critical thinking rather than merely following along with tutorials.

## HackerRank

HackerRank is a technology hiring platform used by over 2,000 companies worldwide to help tech recruiters and hiring managers objectively evaluate talent.

## Udemy

Udemy is a popular online course provider that arranges coursework into a series of modules that can include videos, exercises, and assessments.

## Learn Cantrill

Adrian Cantrill is seen by many in the [AWS certification space](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/) as the best teacher of AWS.

He offers lengthy courses that focus on acquiring skills in the AWS ecosystem.

His philosophy is that courses tailored to passing certifications are a waste of time.

He instead teaches real-world skills and covers topics so deeply such that passing the certification exams is merely a byproduct of completing his courses.
