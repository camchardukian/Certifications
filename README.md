Some organizations I've earned certificates from include:

### FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is an open-source community that offers developers a structured software development curriculum that focuses on project based learning and critical thinking rather than merely following along with tutorials.

### HackerRank

HackerRank is a technology hiring platform used by over 2,000 companies worldwide to help tech recruiters and hiring managers objectively evaluate talent.

### Udemy
